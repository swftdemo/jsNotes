CHALLENGE
************
    Write a ternary that does the same thing as the age challenge

    Age Challenge (if else):

    let age = 30;

    if (age >= 25) {
        console.log("Yay! You can rent a car!");
    } else if (age >= 21) {
        console.log("Yay! You can drink!");
    } else if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("Yay! You can vote!");
    } else {
        console.log("Sorry, you're too young to do anything fun.");
    }
*/

let age = 26;
// (age >= 25) ? console.log("Yay! You can rent a car!") 
//             : (age >= 21) ? console.log("Yay! You can drink!")
//                            : (age>=18) ? console.log("Yay! You can vote!")
//                                        : console.log("Sorry, you're too young to do anything fun.")
let age = 26;

    case age > 24:
        console.log("Yay! You can rent a car!")
    case age > 20:
        console.log("Yay! You can drink!")
    case age > 17:
        console.log("Yay! You can vote!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Sorry, you're too young to do anything fun.");
